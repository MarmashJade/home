			<h1 id="hobbies-top">What I Do in My Spare Time</h1>
			<p>
				I love trying new things and gaining new experiences. In my fourteen years of life, I have been
				lucky enough to try some pretty cool and unique things such as circus aerials and climbing. I've
				also been lucky enough to be able to enjoy doing things I love through extracurriculars and learning
				about new things I enjoy doing at school. Here are just some of the many things I enjoy doing in my
				spare time.

			<h2>Circus</h2>
			<img class="vertical" src="Images/ironCross.jpg" alt="me on the trapeze">
			<p>
				I first started going to circus camp when I was eight and I have been going every summer since. Last
				summer was the first time in six years that I didn't go due to COVID. At circus camp, I learn and
				perform everything from stilt walking and juggling to flying through the air on a swinging trapeze.
				My favourite part of circus is the aerial equipment. This includes things like the trapeze, silks, and 
				hoop. I especially love doing drops. These consist of falling for a few seconds and then catching
				yourself before you actually lose control. I love pushing past the limits of what scares me and the 
				rush of adrenaline I get as I'm falling or flying through the air. Doing circus in and outside of camp 
				has helped be build strength, flexibility and balance as well as taught me many things like how to
				conquer fear, put full trust in someone else, and follow instructions as they're being given out.

			<h2>Skiing</h2>
			<p>
				I've been skiing since I was 7 or 8 years old. Every winter, my family goes on a ski trip, usually to
				a mountain we've never been to before. I've skied in Ontario, Quebec, B.C, Alberta and New York. Being
				able to see so many beautiful views from different mountains and ski down all kinds of different trails
				is one of the reasons that I love the winter so much. I love every single part of the skiing package,
				riding up the chair, enjoying the scenery at the top, racing down the mountain, and finally warming up
				in the chalet with a cup of hot chocolate.

			<h2>Baking</h2>
			<img class="vertical" src="Images/pie.jpg" alt="cherry pie">
			<p>
				I'd always enjoyed baking with my parents and friends when I was younger, but I really got into baking
				independently a few years ago and I started baking regularly during quarantine when I had a lot of extra
				time to spare. I like baking because it helps me to take my mind off of other things and destress. It's
				so easy to get lost in measuring and mixing ingredients and it's very relaxing for me. Additionally,
				after you're done you get food which is always awesome. I have an obsession with all things chocolate so
				when I bake, I tend to make a lot of chocolate things. In quarantine, I started to try baking new things.
				I started making more advanced pastries like breads, macarons and eclairs. I even made an whole pie from scratch
				which took me an entire day. Things don't always turn out perfect and I've had my fair share of fails, but
				I've learned a lot about baking and I hope to continue expanding my baking vocabulary even though I have
				less free time now.

			<h2>Music</h2>
			<img class="wrap" src="Images/piano.jpg" alt="piano">
			<p>
				I've always had a really strong connection to music. I love creating music, playing music, and most of
				all, listening to music. I started learning the piano when I was 6 or 7, and I still take lessons now.
				Additionally, I love to sing. If you ask any of my friends or family members, they'll tell you that I'm
				always singing. I like to sing while I'm playing the accompaniment on the piano and I've also written some
				terrible songs of my own. The reason I love to sing is because I listen to music almost all day. I like
				being introduced to new artists and songs. I'm always willing to listen to a new artist or genre and music
				is one of my favourite things to talk about.

			<h2>Hiking</h2>
			<img class="vertical" src="Images/hiking1.jpg" alt="wooden path with Rockies in the background">
			<p>
				I love being in nature. My family has travelled to multiple national and provincial parks all over Canada
				and I've hiked some pretty amazing trails. I like hiking because it's always peaceful on the trails, and
				walking gives me time to think about nothing and everything at the same time. I also like taking photos 
				along the trails and looking for wildlife and plants. There is so much beauty in nature and I always feel
				happiest when I'm outside.
