			I'm very lucky, I have been able to travel 
			to some very unique and spectacular places 
			in my life. These are some my favourite 
			places I've visited:

			<h2>Hawaii</h2>

			<p>
				In the summer of 2018, my family and I went to<a href="https://www.gohawaii.com/islands/hawaii-big-island">
				Big Island, Hawaii<a/>for a week. It was a very memorable trip for a few reasons. The first reason being
				that it was super beautiful there. We visited several volcanic rock beaches and I went snorkelling for the
				first time. The weather was also really nice and I was able to try a lot of new foods. The other reason was 
				that Big Island was hit by a really big hurricane, the first in decades. Luckily, on the side of the island 
				that we were staying on, we weren't too heavily impacted but a lot of the things we wanted to do were closed
				in preparation for the hurricane. Even though we had to cancel a lot of our plans, it was still an
				amazing experience and I would really like to go back some day.

			<h2>Rockies</h2>

			<p>
				During March break of 2018 my family and I went on a ski trip with my uncle in the Rockies. We mainly skied
				at<a href="https://www.panoramaresort.com/">Panorama ski resort</a>and it was one of the most beautiful
				places I have ever skied. The views from the top of the mountain were absolutely stunning and so many 
				different ski trails to try out. I did my first double diamond trail there and it was awesome because there
				was fresh, untouched powder on that slope. Additionally, we also visited<a href="https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/ab/banff">
				Banff National Park.</a> The beauty of the Rockies is truly indescribable and the grandness of them really
				doesn't translate in pictures. The Rockies are truly amazing geographical wonders.

			<h2>Taiwan</h2>

			<p>
				My mom is from Taiwan so we have gone back there and visited her family several times. Recently we
				haven't been visiting as much though. The most recent trip we took was back in 2014. I have a lot of
				really great memories of my visits to Taiwan from visiting arcades with my uncle, to shopping at the
				night markets with my aunts to visiting Taipei zoo and taking the high speed trains and MRT. I really
				hope to go back there some time soon because I like feeling connected to my mom's family and culture by
				visiting the places she grew up in.

			<h2>South Africa</h2>
			<img class="wrap" src="images/antelope.jpg" alt="antelope with curved horns">
			<p>
				My visit to South Africa was truly one of the most special trips I've ever been on. In the summer of 2015
				we got on a 20-hour flight with my grandparents and then drove 7 hours from the Johannesburg airport to 
				<a href="http://www.krugerpark.co.za/">Kruger National park</a>where we met up with my uncle and aunt.
				Over the course of the 2 weeks that we stayed there we saw all kinds of amazing wild animals from lions
				and leopards to rhinos and elephants. We also visited an elephant sanctuary where we got to ride an 
				elephant! This was a really special trip, not only because I got so many new experiences and saw so many
				cool things, but also because I met my aunt for the first time on that trip.
