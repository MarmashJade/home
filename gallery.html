			<p class="intro">
				Coming from an art school, art has become a very 
				important part of my life. I am constantly creating 
				new pieces and challenging myself and my creativity. 
				However, I am not the best at visual art. I can't draw, 
				paint or sculpt. So, instead of a traditional art 
				gallery, in this gallery you will be able to see 
				some other kinds of art such as poetry, digital 
				art, and photography.
